enums:
  NeuronTypeEnum:
    permissible_values:
      PYRAMIDAL_NEURON:
        description: >- 
          Neurons with a pyramidal shaped cell body (soma) and two distinct dendritic trees.
        meaning: CL:0000598
      INTERNEURON:
        description: Neurons whose axons (and dendrites) are limited to a single brain area.
        meaning: CL:0000099
      MOTOR_NEURON:
        description: >-
          Neurons whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, 
          and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly 
          or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.
        meaning: CL:0000100
      # add more neuron types as needed
  
  GlialCellTypeEnum:
    permissible_values:
      ASTROCYTE:
        description: Characteristic star-shaped glial cells in the brain and spinal cord. 
        meaning: CL:0000127
      OLIGODENDROCYTE:
        description: >- 
          Type of neuroglia whose main functions are to provide support and insulation to axons 
          within the central nervous system (CNS) of jawed vertebrates.
        meaning: CL:0000128
      MICROGLIAL_CELL:
        description: >- 
          Microglia — from micro (small) and glia (glue) — are the resident immune cells of the brain 
          and constantly patrol the cerebral microenvironment to respond to pathogens and damage.
        meaning: CL:0000129
      # add more glial cell types as needed

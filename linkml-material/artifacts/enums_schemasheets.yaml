    permissible_values:
      PYRAMIDAL_NEURON:
        description: Neurons with a pyramidal shaped cell body (soma) and two distinct
          dendritic trees.
        meaning: CL:0000598
      INTERNEURON:
        description: Neurons whose axons (and dendrites) are limited to a single brain
          area.
        meaning: CL:0000099
      MOTOR_NEURON:
        description: Neurons whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem
          or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or
          outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs,
          mainly muscles and glands.
        meaning: CL:0000100
      ASTROCYTE:

      OLIGODENDROCYTE:
        description: Type of neuroglia whose main functions are to provide support
          and insulation to axons within the central nervous system (CNS) of jawed
          vertebrates.
        meaning: CL:0000128
      MICROGLIAL_CELL:
        description: Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and constantly
          patrol the cerebral microenvironment to respond to pathogens and damage.
